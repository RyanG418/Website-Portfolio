            <h4>Backend Development</h4>
            <p>I have experience in backend development, using a range of technologies to build efficient and scalable solutions. In my capstone project, I utilized Python with AWS Lambda to implement a face-blurring feature for video processing. I also used JavaScript to manage video requests, ensuring smooth functionality and performance. Additionally, I have worked with the .NET framework to develop a calorie-tracking app, which involved building robust backend logic and handling data management.</p>

            <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
            <p>I have a strong foundation in frontend development, with proficiency in writing HTML and CSS to build responsive and accessible web interfaces. I am experienced in using Figma for designing and prototyping user interfaces, ensuring a smooth transition from concept to implementation. My skills were further honed during an 8-month capstone project focused on React.js for the frontend, where I developed dynamic, interactive user experiences and applied modern web development best practices.</p>

          <h3>UBC Capstone Project</h3>
          <p>
            During my 8-month capstone project at UBC, I worked on building a serverless video-sharing platform using AWS services. Sponsored by a faculty member, the project had specific requirements and aimed to leverage the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing. As part of a team of five, we collaborated closely through all phases of the project, from initial design to final deployment, using daily stand-ups and agile methodologies to ensure continuous progress. We relied on GitHub for source control and managed our CI/CD pipeline to maintain a seamless development workflow and deliver a high-quality product.

          <h3>Calorie Tracking App</h3>
          <p>I developed a calorie counting app using C# and the .NET framework, with SQL database integration to efficiently manage and store user data. Designed in Figma, the app was created for both desktop and iOS platforms to provide a seamless user experience across devices. Key features of the app include item tracking, detailed macronutrient information, and visual progress indicators through graphs and charts, allowing users to easily monitor their dietary habits and progress toward their fitness goals.</p>
